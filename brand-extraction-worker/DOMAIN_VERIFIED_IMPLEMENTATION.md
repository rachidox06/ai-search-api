# Domain Verified Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Deployed

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

Added `domain_verified` boolean field throughout the entire brand extraction pipeline to track which brand domains have been verified via DNS lookup.

## 📊 Data Flow

```
1. OpenAI extracts brand → includes domain (or null)
                          ↓
2. DNS verification → Sets domain_verified flag
                          ↓
3. brand_mentions table → Stores domain_verified per mention
                          ↓
4. canonical_brands table → Aggregates verification status
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### `brand_mentions` Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE brand_mentions 
ADD COLUMN domain_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```
- Tracks verification status for EACH individual mention
- `true` = domain passed DNS check at extraction time
- `false` = domain was null OR failed DNS check

### `canonical_brands` Table
```sql
ALTER TABLE canonical_brands 
ADD COLUMN domain_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false;
```
- Tracks if ANY mention of this brand has EVER been verified
- Once `true`, stays `true` (never downgrades)
- Used for filtering master brand list

## 🔍 How Verification Works

### Step 1: OpenAI Extraction
```typescript
// OpenAI returns (temp = 0.0 for accuracy)
{
  name: "Apple",
  domain: "apple.com",  // or null if unsure
  sentiment: 85,
  ranking_position: 1
}
```

### Step 2: DNS Verification
```typescript
// For each brand with a domain:
const isValid = await dns.resolve(domain);

// Sets domain_verified based on result:
domain_verified: true   // DNS passed
domain_verified: false  // DNS failed or domain was null
```

### Step 3: Canonical Brand Sync
```sql
-- Postgres function logic:
IF p_domain_verified THEN
  domain_verified = true  -- Upgrade to verified
ELSE
  domain_verified = domain_verified  -- Keep existing value (never downgrade)
END IF
```

## 💡 Use Cases

### 1. Filter Verified Brands Only
```sql
-- Get only brands with verified domains
SELECT * FROM canonical_brands 
WHERE domain_verified = true;
```

### 2. Find Brands Needing Review
```sql
-- Popular brands without verified domains
SELECT canonical_name, canonical_website, total_mentions
FROM canonical_brands
WHERE domain_verified = false
  AND total_mentions > 5
ORDER BY total_mentions DESC;
```

### 3. Analytics Dashboard
```sql
-- Verification rate metrics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_brands,
  SUM(CASE WHEN domain_verified THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as verified_count,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN domain_verified THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as verification_rate
FROM canonical_brands;
```

### 4. Quality Control
```sql
-- Show verification status in brand reports
SELECT 
  bm.brand_name,
  bm.brand_website,
  bm.domain_verified,
  cb.canonical_name,
  cb.domain_verified as canonical_verified
FROM brand_mentions bm
LEFT JOIN canonical_brands cb ON bm.canonical_brand_id = cb.id
WHERE bm.result_id = 'some-result-id';
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Applications

### Badge Display
```typescript
{brand.domain_verified ? (
  <Badge color="green">✓ Verified Domain</Badge>
) : (
  <Badge color="gray">Unverified</Badge>
)}
```

### Filter Controls
```typescript
// Allow users to toggle verified-only view
<Checkbox>
  Only show brands with verified domains
</Checkbox>
```

### Data Quality Indicator
```typescript
const verificationRate = (verifiedBrands / totalBrands) * 100;
<ProgressBar value={verificationRate} />
<Text>{verificationRate}% of brands have verified domains</Text>
```

## 📈 Expected Behavior

### Scenario 1: Well-Known Brand
```
Input: "Apple is the best"
OpenAI: { name: "Apple", domain: "apple.com" }
DNS: ✅ apple.com exists
Result: domain_verified = true
```

### Scenario 2: Unknown Brand
```
Input: "SmallStartup is great"
OpenAI: { name: "SmallStartup", domain: null }
DNS: ⏭️ skipped (no domain)
Result: domain_verified = false
```

### Scenario 3: Hallucinated Domain
```
Input: "FakeCorp mentioned"
OpenAI: { name: "FakeCorp", domain: "fakecorp-official.com" }
DNS: ❌ fakecorp-official.com doesn't exist
Result: domain = null, domain_verified = false
```

### Scenario 4: Wrong But Real Domain
```
Input: "AWS is popular"
OpenAI: { name: "AWS", domain: "aws.com" }  // Wrong, should be aws.amazon.com
DNS: ✅ aws.com exists (some other site)
Result: domain_verified = true  // ⚠️ DNS can't detect wrong matches
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

DNS verification CAN:
- ✅ Catch completely fake/invented domains
- ✅ Catch typos (gogle.com vs google.com)
- ✅ Verify domain exists

DNS verification CANNOT:
- ❌ Verify domain belongs to the correct brand
- ❌ Distinguish between similar domains
- ❌ Check if domain is the "official" one

For higher accuracy, see Phase 2/3 solutions (Clearbit, knowledge base, etc.)

## 🔄 Hybrid Approach Benefits

This implementation gives you **maximum flexibility**:

1. **Keep all data** - Never lose brand mentions
2. **Filter when needed** - Query for verified brands only
3. **Analyze quality** - Track verification rates over time
4. **Improve gradually** - Build knowledge base of verified brands
5. **User choice** - Let users decide verified-only vs. all brands

## 📊 Monitoring Queries

### Daily Verification Report
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_mentions,
  SUM(CASE WHEN domain_verified THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as verified,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN domain_verified THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as rate
FROM brand_mentions
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Top Unverified Brands
```sql
SELECT 
  canonical_name,
  canonical_website,
  total_mentions,
  first_seen_at,
  last_seen_at
FROM canonical_brands
WHERE domain_verified = false
  AND canonical_website IS NOT NULL  -- Has a domain but not verified
ORDER BY total_mentions DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor** the verification rates for a week
2. **Review** top unverified brands manually
3. **Build** knowledge base of common brands (Phase 2)
4. **Consider** Clearbit/Exa for remaining unverified brands (Phase 3)

## ✅ Success Metrics

Track these over time:
- % of brand mentions with `domain_verified = true`
- Number of brands with null domains
- Number of domains invalidated by DNS check
- User trust in brand data quality

---

**Implementation Complete!** You now have a robust verification system that balances data completeness with quality control.
