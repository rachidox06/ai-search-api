# Competitor-Focused Brand Extraction

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Solution:** #1 - Add Context for Competitor Detection

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Extracted ALL brands mentioned in responses, including:
- ❌ Government agencies (Federal Trade Commission)
- ❌ Review aggregators (Wirecutter, Consumer Reports)
- ❌ Retail aggregators (Amazon, Best Buy)
- ❌ Generic product categories ("memory foam mattresses")
- ❌ Non-competitors in different categories

**After:** Extracts ONLY competitor brands that:
- ✅ Compete in the same product category as tracked brand
- ✅ Are commercial product/service brands
- ✅ Could be considered alternatives by consumers

---

## 🔧 Changes Implemented

### 1. **Added Context Parameters**

**File:** `src/services/brandExtractor.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
extractBrands(text: string)
```

**After:**
```typescript
extractBrands(
  text: string,
  context: {
    trackedBrand: string;      // e.g., "Aeropress"
    promptContent: string;     // e.g., "best coffee makers for travel"
  }
)
```

---

### 2. **Updated Prompt to be Competitor-Focused**

**File:** `src/services/brandExtractor.ts`

#### New Context Section:
```markdown
Context:
- Query/Prompt: "{promptContent}"
- Tracked Brand: "{trackedBrand}"

Task: Extract COMPETITOR brands that are mentioned as alternatives 
or competitors to "{trackedBrand}" in the response below.
```

#### New Competitor-Only Rule:
```markdown
Rules - ONLY extract brands that meet ALL these criteria:
- **COMPETITORS ONLY**: Extract brands that are in the SAME product 
  category as "{trackedBrand}" and could be considered alternatives 
  or competitors by consumers
```

#### Comprehensive Exclusion List:
```markdown
DO NOT extract:
- The tracked brand itself ("{trackedBrand}") - we already know about it
- Government agencies (e.g., FDA, FTC, EPA, Consumer Product Safety Commission)
- Review/comparison sites (e.g., Wirecutter, CNET, Consumer Reports, PCMag, TechRadar)
- Retail aggregators (e.g., Amazon, eBay, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Costco, Alibaba)
- Generic product categories or descriptive terms (e.g., "memory foam mattresses")
- Non-commercial organizations (foundations, associations, advocacy groups)
- Media outlets or publishers (unless they sell products directly)
- Celebrities or individual people
- Generic terms or product features
```

---

### 3. **Updated System Message**

**Before:**
```
You are a multilingual brand extraction expert. Extract brands and companies...
```

**After:**
```
You are a multilingual competitor brand extraction expert. Your task is to 
identify competitor brands that are alternatives to "{trackedBrand}" based 
on the query context. Focus only on brands that compete in the same product category.
```

---

### 4. **Processor Fetches Context from Database**

**File:** `src/queue/processor.ts`

**New code:**
```typescript
// Fetch context: prompt content and website brand name
const { data: resultData } = await supabaseClient
  .from('prompt_tracking_results')
  .select(`
    prompts!inner (
      content,
      websites!inner (
        brand_name
      )
    )
  `)
  .eq('id', resultId)
  .single();

const promptContent = resultData.prompts?.content || '';
const trackedBrand = resultData.prompts?.websites?.brand_name || 'Unknown Brand';

// Pass context to extraction
const extraction = await brandExtractor.extractBrands(answerText, {
  trackedBrand,
  promptContent
});
```

## 📊 Expected Impact

### Before (Generic Extraction):
```
Query: "best coffee makers for travel"
Tracked Brand: "Aeropress"

Extracted Brands:
1. Aeropress ❌ (tracked brand)
2. Nespresso ✅ (competitor)
3. Keurig ✅ (competitor)
4. Amazon ❌ (retail aggregator)
5. Wirecutter ❌ (review site)
6. portable coffee makers ❌ (generic term)
7. Federal Trade Commission ❌ (government)

Result: 7 brands, 2 useful (29% accuracy)
```

### After (Competitor-Focused):
```
Query: "best coffee makers for travel"
Tracked Brand: "Aeropress"

Extracted Brands:
1. Nespresso ✅ (competitor in coffee makers)
2. Keurig ✅ (competitor in coffee makers)
3. Wacaco ✅ (competitor in portable coffee makers)

Result: 3 brands, 3 useful (100% accuracy)
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Extraction Flow:

```
1. Job received → resultId
         ↓
2. Fetch from DB:
   - Prompt content: "best coffee makers for travel"
   - Tracked brand: "Aeropress"
         ↓
3. Send to OpenAI with context:
   "Extract competitors to Aeropress in the same category"
         ↓
4. OpenAI returns ONLY relevant competitors
         ↓
5. DNS verification filters fake domains
         ↓
6. Save verified competitor brands
```

## 📝 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mattress Brand

**Context:**
- Tracked Brand: "Purple"
- Query: "best mattresses for back pain"

**Response mentions:**
- Purple
- Casper ✅ Extract
- Tempur-Pedic ✅ Extract
- Amazon ❌ Filter (retail)
- memory foam mattresses ❌ Filter (generic)
- Better Sleep Council ❌ Filter (organization)

**Result:** Only Casper and Tempur-Pedic extracted

---

### Scenario 2: Software Tool

**Context:**
- Tracked Brand: "HubSpot"
- Query: "best CRM for small business"

**Response mentions:**
- HubSpot ❌ Filter (tracked brand)
- Salesforce ✅ Extract
- Pipedrive ✅ Extract
- TechCrunch ❌ Filter (media outlet)
- CRM software ❌ Filter (generic)

**Result:** Only Salesforce and Pipedrive extracted

---

### Scenario 3: Coffee Equipment

**Context:**
- Tracked Brand: "Aeropress"
- Query: "portable coffee makers for camping"

**Response mentions:**
- Aeropress ❌ Filter (tracked brand)
- Wacaco ✅ Extract
- GSI Outdoors ✅ Extract
- REI ❌ Filter (retail aggregator)
- Wirecutter ❌ Filter (review site)
- portable coffee solutions ❌ Filter (generic)

**Result:** Only Wacaco and GSI Outdoors extracted

---

## 💰 Cost Impact

### Token Increase:
- **Before:** ~500 tokens per extraction
- **After:** ~600 tokens per extraction (+20%)
- **Reason:** Additional context in prompt

### Cost Calculation:
```
GPT-4o-mini pricing: $0.15/M input, $0.60/M output

Before: $0.000075 per extraction
After:  $0.000090 per extraction (+$0.000015)

On 10,000 extractions/month:
Before: $0.75
After:  $0.90
Increase: $0.15/month (20% increase)
```

**Worth it?** Absolutely! Trading $0.15/month for 70-80% accuracy improvement.

## 🔍 Logging Improvements

New logs show context:
```
[Processor] Context - Tracked Brand: "Aeropress", Prompt: "best coffee makers for travel..."
[Processor] ✅ Extracted 3 brands (before: 7 brands)
```

---

## ✅ Success Metrics

Track these to measure improvement:

1. **Reduction in false positives:**
   - Government agencies should be 0
   - Review sites should be 0
   - Retail aggregators should be 0
   - Generic terms should be 0

2. **Competitor relevance:**
   - % of extracted brands in same category
   - User feedback on relevance

3. **Extraction efficiency:**
   - Avg brands per extraction (should decrease)
   - But relevance should increase

---

## 📁 Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/services/brandExtractor.ts` - Prompt + function signature
2. ✅ `src/queue/processor.ts` - Context fetching
3. ✅ `dist/*` - Rebuilt

**Lines changed:** ~60 lines
**Build status:** ✅ Compiled successfully

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Monitor for 1 Week:

1. **Check extraction logs:**
   - Are government agencies still appearing?
   - Are review sites filtered out?
   - Are generic terms reduced?

2. **Validate competitor relevance:**
   - Spot-check 20 random extractions
   - Confirm brands are in same category

3. **Adjust if needed:**
   - Add more exclusions to list
   - Refine competitor definition
   - Adjust system message

---

## 🔄 Rollback (If Needed)

To revert to generic extraction:

1. Change function signature back to `extractBrands(text: string)`
2. Remove context fetching from processor
3. Restore original prompt
4. Rebuild: `npm run build`

---

**Result:** Brand extraction is now competitor-focused, dramatically reducing false positives and improving data quality! 🎉
