# ‚úÖ Implementation Complete: Per-Prompt Scheduling

## üéâ Summary

Successfully implemented **Option 1: Per-Prompt `next_run_at` Scheduling**. Your cron job now runs based on individual user timing instead of a fixed global schedule.

---

## ‚ú® What Changed

### 1. Database Migration ‚úÖ

**Added to `prompts` table:**
- `next_run_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ) - Scheduled time for next cron execution
- Index on `next_run_at` for efficient queries
- Initialized all existing prompts with appropriate `next_run_at` values

**Migration applied:** `add_next_run_at_to_prompts`

### 2. Code Changes ‚úÖ

#### Updated Files:
1. **`cron-scheduler/libs/locationMapping.js`**
   - Modified `shouldRunPrompt()` - Now checks `next_run_at <= NOW()` instead of calculating days
   - Added `calculateNextRunAt()` - Calculates next run time based on frequency

2. **`libs/locationMapping.js`** (main lib)
   - Same updates as above for consistency

3. **`cron-scheduler/index.js`**
   - Updated `CRON_SCHEDULE` default: `'0 * * * *'` (every hour instead of 2 AM daily)
   - Updated `fetchActivePrompts()`:
     - Now queries `WHERE next_run_at <= NOW()`
     - Returns only prompts that are due to run
     - Orders by `next_run_at` (oldest first)
   - Updated `processPrompt()`:
     - Extracts `check_frequency` from prompt
     - Calculates `next_run_at` after successful run
     - Updates both `last_run_at` and `next_run_at` in database
     - Logs next scheduled run time
   - Enhanced logging to show per-prompt scheduling status

4. **`cron-scheduler/README.md`**
   - Updated documentation to reflect new per-prompt scheduling
   - Added examples and troubleshooting for the new approach

## üîÑ How It Works Now

### Before (Old System)
```
Global cron at 2 AM UTC
  ‚Üì
Fetch ALL active prompts
  ‚Üì
Filter by: (NOW - last_run_at) >= 24 hours
  ‚Üì
Process filtered prompts
  ‚Üì
Update last_run_at

‚ùå Problem: Users who sign up at 12 PM get skipped at 2 AM (only 14 hours)
```

### After (New System)
```
Cron runs every hour
  ‚Üì
Fetch prompts WHERE next_run_at <= NOW
  ‚Üì
Process each prompt
  ‚Üì
Calculate: next_run_at = NOW + frequency
  ‚Üì
Update last_run_at AND next_run_at

‚úÖ Solution: Each prompt runs exactly 24h after last run, regardless of signup time
```

---

## üìä Example Timeline

### User signs up at 3:47 PM on Monday

**Old System (Broken):**
```
Mon 3:47 PM: ‚úÖ First check
Tue 2:00 AM: ‚ùå SKIP (only 10h 13min < 24h)
Wed 2:00 AM: ‚úÖ Run (34h 13min > 24h) - 38 HOUR GAP!
```

**New System (Fixed):**
```
Mon 3:47 PM: ‚úÖ First check ‚Üí next_run_at = Tue 3:47 PM
Tue 4:00 PM: ‚úÖ Cron picks it up (within hour window) ‚Üí next_run_at = Wed 4:00 PM
Wed 4:00 PM: ‚úÖ Run ‚Üí next_run_at = Thu 4:00 PM

Result: Consistent ~24h intervals! ‚úÖ
```

---

## üîç Verification

Let me verify the implementation is working:

### Database Check
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  check_frequency,
  is_active,
  last_run_at,
  next_run_at,
  CASE 
    WHEN next_run_at <= NOW() THEN 'DUE NOW'
    ELSE 'SCHEDULED'
  END as status
FROM prompts 
WHERE is_active = true
LIMIT 10;
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ All active prompts have `next_run_at` populated

---

## üöÄ What Happens Next

### Immediate (Next Hour)
1. Cron runs on the hour (e.g., 3:00 PM)
2. Queries for prompts where `next_run_at <= NOW()`
3. Processes due prompts
4. Updates `next_run_at` for each processed prompt

### After First Run
- Each prompt will have its own unique `next_run_at` based on when it was processed
- Future runs will be distributed throughout the day
- No more 2 AM spike - even load distribution!

---

## üìù Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Default (Recommended):**
```bash
CRON_SCHEDULE='0 * * * *'  # Every hour
```

**More Precise (Optional):**
```bash
CRON_SCHEDULE='*/30 * * * *'  # Every 30 minutes
CRON_SCHEDULE='*/15 * * * *'  # Every 15 minutes (most precise)
```

**Less Frequent (Optional):**
```bash
CRON_SCHEDULE='0 */6 * * *'  # Every 6 hours
```

### How to Deploy

If your cron scheduler is on Railway:

1. **Update Environment Variable:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard ‚Üí cron-scheduler service
   - Add/Update: `CRON_SCHEDULE=0 * * * *`
   - Service will auto-redeploy

2. **Monitor Logs:**
   ```
   Watch for:
   - "Per-Prompt Scheduling" in startup message
   - "Fetching prompts due for execution..."
   - "Scheduled next_run_at: [timestamp]"
   ```

3. **Verify:**
   - Check Supabase `prompts` table
   - Verify `next_run_at` is being updated after runs
   - Confirm prompts run ~24h apart

## üîß Maintenance & Monitoring

### SQL Queries for Monitoring

**Check upcoming prompts:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  check_frequency,
  next_run_at,
  next_run_at - NOW() as time_until_next_run
FROM prompts
WHERE is_active = true
  AND next_run_at > NOW()
ORDER BY next_run_at
LIMIT 20;
```

**Check overdue prompts (if any):**
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  check_frequency,
  next_run_at,
  NOW() - next_run_at as overdue_by
FROM prompts
WHERE is_active = true
  AND next_run_at < NOW()
ORDER BY next_run_at;
```

**Distribution of next runs:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', next_run_at) as scheduled_hour,
  COUNT(*) as prompt_count
FROM prompts
WHERE is_active = true
  AND next_run_at > NOW()
  AND next_run_at < NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY scheduled_hour
ORDER BY scheduled_hour;
```

## üö® Important Notes

### What's NOT Changed
- ‚úÖ Manual runs via UI/API still work the same
- ‚úÖ Existing prompts continue to work
- ‚úÖ Same total API calls per day (just distributed)
- ‚úÖ Same cost structure
- ‚úÖ All engines (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) work the same

### Manual Runs Behavior
**Currently:** Manual runs do NOT update `next_run_at`. This means:
- Users can manually run prompts anytime without affecting their schedule
- Cron schedule remains independent of manual checks
- This is the **recommended** behavior to keep things predictable

**Alternative (if you want to change this):**
You can make manual runs update `next_run_at` by modifying `/api/v1/prompt-runs/batch` endpoint to also update the field.

---

## üìû Need to Rollback?

If something goes wrong, you can temporarily revert:

```sql
-- Option 1: Set all next_run_at to NOW() to force immediate run
UPDATE prompts SET next_run_at = NOW() WHERE is_active = true;

-- Option 2: Remove the column (not recommended unless major issues)
ALTER TABLE prompts DROP COLUMN next_run_at;
-- Then redeploy old code
```

## ‚ú® Conclusion

**You now have a production-ready per-prompt scheduling system!**

Each user gets their own schedule based on when they sign up or run prompts. No more awkward gaps or fixed global timing.

The system is:
- ‚úÖ User-friendly
- ‚úÖ Scalable
- ‚úÖ Cost-neutral
- ‚úÖ Better performing
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard

**Next Steps:**
1. Deploy the cron scheduler with updated code
2. Monitor logs for first few runs
3. Verify `next_run_at` is being updated correctly
4. Check that prompts run at expected intervals

üöÄ **You're all set!**
